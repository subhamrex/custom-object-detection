# custom-object-detection

I have made this custom object detection model using OpenCv and Cascade Trainer GUI App (https://amin-ahmadi.com/cascade-trainer-gui/).

Gather your trainning using data_colector.py and train it in Cascade Trainee GUI app. After that detect your custom object using custom_object_detection.py file.
